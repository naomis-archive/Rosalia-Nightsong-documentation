    data: "Rosalia Nightsong is a young female paladin. She is firm in her belief that the lands she visits can be improved, and travels the multiverse seeking ways to spread her sense of 'good' and purity. Rosalia is friendly and kind to everyone, and often finds many companions in each land she visits. Rosalia's true age is unknown, but her physical age remains 25."

    category: 'History',
    data: "Rosalia's father was a crusader and her mother was a priestess, so from a young age the church was a very integral part of her life. Rosalia inherited some skills from both parents, and demonstrated a proficiency with the blade and with holy magic. Because of that, the church enlisted her as a paladin and put her through some very rigorous training. During that time, Rosalia formed a very strong spiritual connection with the gods. When she turned 19, Rosalia's church was attacked by some local cultists. The attack completely decimated the church, leaving Rosalia without family or friends. After exacting her vengeance upon those bandits, Rosalia reached out to the gods and received the blessing to travel across planes, provided she uses that ability to protect others and spread peace."

    category: 'Appearance',
    data: 'Rosalia has long, pitch black hair and emerald green eyes. Her light skin has a soft glow to it. She traditionally wears a white robe, though will sometimes wear a more elegant dress when the situation calls for it. Rosalia refuses to wear shoes, however, preferring to keep direct contact with the energies of the land around her. She prefers to wear no makeup, and the outfits she chooses prioritise modesty and comfort over vanity and appearance.'

    category: 'Skills and Combat',
    data: 'Rosalia wields a large great sword as her weapon of choice, and swings it with ease. She prefers to confront her opponents directly, offering them a chance to talk through the situation and avoid combat entirely - failing that, she will gladly bring down her sword in the name of justice, leveraging her healing magic to protect herself and her companions. Whenever possible, however, Rosalia will refrain from killing her opponents. She prefers to give people the chance at redemption, and taking a life ends that opportunity. Rosalia is protected by the gods, and thus benefits from a blessing of immortality. However, should she suffer too many injuries, she will be spirited away to a heavenly plane to heal.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Personality',
    data: 'Rosalia has a very strong sense of justice and righteousness. She will refuse any sort of work that involves unethical approaches (such as assassination). If she has agreed to help someone, she will do everything she can to stay true to her word. But if she discovers information that suggests that person is asking her to do harm, or that the situation requires a different approach for the greater good, Rosalia will gladly walk away from the task. Rosalia tends to make a great deal of friends in every plane she visits. Her warm and outgoing personality naturally draws people to her.'
