<h1>Contributing Art for Rosalia</h1>
<p>
  Rosalia's <code>art</code> command returns a random image of Rosalia provided
  by a generous contributor. If you are interested in providing art, please
  follow these instructions!
</p>
<p>
  First, upload the image to Rosalia's repository. The file should go in the
  `./img` folder. Name your file <code>yourname#.ext</code>, where "yourname" is
  your name or username (no spaces!), # is the number of art pieces you have
  contributed (so if this is your first, use 1), and "ext" is the file
  extension.
</p>
<p>
  Then head to the Rosalia's code and find the file located at
  `./src/utils/commands/artList.ts`. This is where you will add your art to her
  command. At the bottom of the file, <em>just before</em> the closing
  <code>]</code> symbol, add the following code:
</p>
<pre><code>
{{ '{' }}
  file_name: "The file name from above.",
  artist: "Your name or username.",
  artist_url: "Your homepage link.",
{{ '}' }},
</code></pre>
<p>
  Be sure to replace the values with the correct information. Once this is done,
  you should submit a pull request as documented in
  <a routerLink="/contribute">the contributing instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you have questions, get stuck, or would rather just send the art directly,
  you may contact us at our

  and we will be more than happy to assist!
