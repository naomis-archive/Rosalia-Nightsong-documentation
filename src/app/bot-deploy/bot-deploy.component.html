<h1>Run the Bot</h1>
<p>
  The next step is to invite your bot application to your server. You can use
  the Discord Developer portal to generate an invitation link, or you can use
  the Client ID from your bot's application page to create a link yourself. If
  you wish to manually create the link, the format is:
</p>
<p>
  <code
    >https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot</code
  >
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of which method you choose, the link will open a new window
  allowing you to choose which server you'd like to add your bot to.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have added the bot to your server, switch back to your terminal and
  run the command <code>npm start</code>. If you have set the
  <code>WH_ID</code> and <code>WH_TOKEN</code> in your environment
  appropriately, the bot should send a message indicating it is online.
  Otherwise, you should see the text <code>Bot ready!</code> in your
  terminal, indicating your bot is online! Now you can try some of the commands
  to see if the bot is functioning correctly.
</p>
<h2>Host a Live Version of the Bot</h2>
<p>
  By now you should have a successfully running local instance of the bot.
  Keeping this alive means you cannot shut down your computer. As an
  alternative, you might want to use a hosting service to run a live instance of
  your bot. We use Heroku for our version, but there are other options. Be sure
  to read the documentation for your chosen platform! Heroku, for example, uses
  a separate setting for the bot token instead of a <code>.env</code> file.
