<h1>Run your version of Rosalia</h1>
<p>
  The next step is to invite your version of Rosalia to your server. You can use
  the Discord Developer portal to generate an invitation link, or you can use
  the Client ID from your Rosalia's application page to create a link yourself.
  If you wish to manually create the link, the format is:
</p>
<p>
  <code
    >https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot</code
  >
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of which method you choose, the link will open a new window
  allowing you to choose which server you'd like to add Rosalia to.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have added her to your server, switch back to your terminal and run
  the command <code>npm start</code>. If you have set the <code>WH_ID</code> and
  <code>WH_TOKEN</code> in your environment appropriately, she should send a
  message indicating it is online. Now you can try some of the commands to see
  if she is functioning correctly.
</p>
<h2>Host a Live Version of Rosalia</h2>
<p>
  By now you should have a successfully running local instance of Rosalia's
  code. Keeping this alive means you cannot shut down your computer. As an
  alternative, you might want to use a hosting service to run your live
  instance. We use Heroku for our version, but there are other options. Be sure
  to read the documentation for your chosen platform! Heroku, for example, uses
  a separate setting for the token instead of a <code>.env</code> file.
