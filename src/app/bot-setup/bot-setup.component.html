<h1>Creating Your Bot Application and Connecting it to Your Instance</h1>
<p>
  Once your environment is set up, you need to connect the code to a Discord Bot
  application. If you have not created a Discord Bot application, you will need
  to follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Log in to the
    <a
      href="https://discord.com/developers/applications"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Discord Developer site</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>Create a new application by clicking on the "New Application" button.</li>
  <li>On the left, select "Bot", then create a new bot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a Webhook (Optional)</h2>
<p>
  The bot is configured to send an online notice, and updates on servers it
  leaves or joins, through a Discord Webhook. In your server, create a new
  Webhook and copy the URL. You will need the ID and Token from that URL for the
  next step. These values are obtained from the URL in the format:
</p>
<p><code>https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/ID/TOKEN</code></p>
<h2>Link your Bot to the Code</h2>
<p>
  Now that you have a bot, you'll need to create a file called
  <code>.env</code>. You can either create the file manually, or copy the
  <code>.env.example</code> file. This file will contain the following
  variables:
</p>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let envVar of envVars">
    <code>{{ envVar.name }}</code> ({{ envVar.optional }}) -
    <span [innerHTML]="envVar.description"></span>
  </li>
</ul>

<a class="page-btn" routerLink="/deploy">Next Page</a>
