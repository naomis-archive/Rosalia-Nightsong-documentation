  Here you will find instructions for setting up a local version of the bot,
  contributing to the bot's development, adding the bot to your Discord server,
  and using the bot's commands.

<p>
  Rosalia is a Discord bot designed for running special events. The code is
  designed to be modular, so events can be disabled/enabled through a single
  environment variable change.
</p>
<p>
  As the bot is always considered a work in progress, these documents will be
  updated alongside new versions of the bot. Should there be a discrepancy
  between the two, feel free to let us know with an issue request on GitHub!
