<h1>Set up a Local Instance</h1>
<p>
  There are a few steps you will need in order to set up a local instance of the
  bot. You will need some knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript, node, and git. If
  you are not comfortable with doing this, you can

    >join our server</a
  >
  to participate in the bot's events there.
</p>
<h2>Clone the GitHub Repository</h2>
<p>
  Before doing anything else, you have to make sure you have a GitHub Account.
  If you do not have one, we recommend signing up for free
  <a href="https://github.com/join">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have signed in to GitHub, navigate to our
  <a
    href="https://github.com/nhcarrigan/Rosalia-Nightsong"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >GitHub repository</a
  >
  and either fork the repository into your own account or download the files to
  your computer.
</p>
<h2>Install the Necessary Software</h2>
<p>
  Using your preferred development environment (if you do not have one, we
  recommend either
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</a>
  or
  <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atom</a
  >), load the directory containing your copy of the bot files.
</p>

<p>
  Before you do anything else, make sure that Node.js and npm are installed. If
  you do not have Node.js and <code>npm</code> installed, you can do so from the
  <a
    href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >Node.js website</a
  >. Open the terminal - you will now need to install some packages using
  <code>npm</code>. Enter the following commands into the terminal to perform
  the installations:
</p>
<p>
  <code>npm install</code> - This will install all of the dependencies found in
  the <code>package.json</code> file automatically. If this does not work, you
  will need to go through each item listed in that file and run
  <code>npm install [packagename]</code>
</p>
<p>
  <code>npm run build</code> - This will build the TypeScript files into
  runnable JavaScript files.
</p>
<p>
  Congratulations! You are now ready to run the code locally - the start command
  is <code>npm run start</code>. To connect the code to your Discord Bot
  application, continue reading below.
